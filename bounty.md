# Where we need help

Thank you for getting here.  This is your opportunity to be one of the first in the world to put
your fingerprints on an AI model in a scalable, open source approach.  But your time is valuable
so in this early phase, we want to focus contributions in the areas that will be most impactful
to prove this model.

## Prerequisite

* Markdown expert and converter
  * Check with Dan Walsh if you need some tips here

## Needed Skills

* RHEL Firewall configurations
* Systemd configurations
* Podman
* Converting Docker Compose to Kubernetes YAML
* Red Hat OpenShift for AWS / Azure Red Hat OpenShift configuration
* Quarkus LLM usage
* OpenShift Pipeline configuration

## Needed Knowledge

Knowledge requires source documentation as well as skills that demonstrate that knowledge.

* RHEL Configuration Best Practices
* FedRAMP Knowledge
* RHEL ABI Policies
* Red Hat Subscription Model
* Red Hat History

### Knowledge Submission Examples

In the case of FedRamp, this would be what is required to make for a good submission:

1. A collection of documents, converted to [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
1. A small set of question and answer prompts that represent what you would expect based on this knowledge.
    1. For the best results, the questions should have good coverage over the provided document.  For example, instead of providing
     5 questions for the 500+ page FedRamp document, it might be better to include the three most relevant chapters as Markdown,
     with 5 questions for each chapter.
